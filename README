This is a repository for the workings of my python3 code to address the rosalind problems. 
The code isn't designed for functionality and is likely not the most elegant solution but hopefully will help someone struggling to learn.
For ipynb notebook files if not displaying correctly on github paste URL into https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ and that should display correctly.
